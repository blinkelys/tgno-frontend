# GENERAL RULES

## 1. Core Rules for Participants

### 1.1 Identification

We require that all participants bring ID. This is key to having a complete overview participants and who is in The Vikingskipet.

Valid ID’s are: Passports, Driver’s Licenses, Bank Cards with images and other valid national/international ID by norwegian authorities.

If your child does not have a valid ID, please contact us.

### 1.2 Participants under 16

Participants that haven’t turned 16 during the time they arrive at The Gathering must have consent from parents in order to participate.

We have provided a [consent form](#) which must be uploaded to Geekevents or brought in physically.

Those without the consent form will be rejected during check-in.

### 1.3 Zero Tolerance Policy

We have ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY for any form of harassment, not limited to; bullying, discrimination

### 1.4 Be alert, take care of each other

As a participant, you have a duty to make sure to take care of one another. If you see someone who is not well, talk to the person or contact Security.

The least you can do is tell a Crew member so that we can examine the situation.

If you think the situation is in danger for one’s health, contact emergency services immediately.

### 1.5 During an emergency

Should there be a situation where the Vikingskipet must evacuate, then you will be notified via our PA system and lights will be switched on. All events will be stopped.

Security crew monitor all security systems and fire alarms, and will react immediately should there be something out of the norm.

**What to do when an emergency happens or an emergency is imminent:**

- **Shut down all music/loud noises.** This ensures a safe evacuation and that you and others can hear any announcements. When the lights turn on without any reason, shut down all music, this is a sign that something needs your attention.
- **Go to your nearest emergency exit.** Do this at a relaxed tempo and do not bring with you your PC or baggage. This will hinder an organized evacuation. Help each other and follow instructions from Security crew who will be clothed in Hi-vis jackets.
- **Should there be a fire - trigger nearest fire alarm, call 110 and alert nearest crew member.**
- **Follow instructions from Security Crew, Fire Brigade and Police**, and further instructions from PA system/Megaphone.
- **For immediate emergencies, contact a crew member for help** or **call the relevant emergency services.**

  Remember to always contact a crew member as fast as possible during an emergency - even if you have contacted emergency services.

The Gathering has a large group of experienced safety personnel, medical personnel, and doctors that have the skills and equipment to provide first aid. By alerting the crew early, we can get our resources quickly to where it is needed.

Security and Medic always has contact with the coordinators for Security Management, who can contact emergency services at any point.
